## My Journey into Tech

![I realised I couldn't have the artistic freedom or a work schedule that would enable me to attend concerts working in the arts, so I changed careers to become an administrator for University of Birmingham. I felt unchallenged in this role and explored the world of tech by learning to code and taking a course on cybersecurity from Open University. I built a website for a local business, Vulcan Bicycle Works, joined Junior Developer Group, and volunteered for Scottish Tech Army. I then attended School of Code.](./journey.drawio.svg)

## Project Details

#### CSS Support for Tech for Good Summit 2021 website

Working on the HeySummit platform, provided CSS support and advice to the lead developer on the project, which allowed us to meet the design requirements of the event on an inflexible platform.

### Junior Developer Group

Junior Developer Group is a community for junior developers to build open-source projects together in an Agile way.

#### Sleep Quality Calculator

I served as project lead on this project, which involved:

- Considering how each member could best contribute and assigning tasks to members based on the skills they wanted to develop, their current skill level, and the needs of the project
- Setting an approach for the project that reduced the work needed to make the website mobile-responsive and ensuring team members understood the requirements
- Reviewing code and providing clear, actionable feedback

My individual code contributions include:

- Reviewing the website's score in Google Lighthouse and implementing the changes needed to meet a minimum of 90 points in all categories
- Implementation of calculator section
- Research of additional resources and the implementation of that section
- Creating CSS-drawn clouds and enabling their reusability by writing clear documentation

My individual contributions include:

- Designing the team's logo, taking into account its appearance at small sizes and on both light and dark background colours
- Implementing the Thank You page, which dynamically generates cards based on an array of data
- Creating a semantic and mobile-responsive structure for the footer
